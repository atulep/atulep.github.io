# My website
Built using Quarto. The following are useful resources:

* https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html
* https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/

To publish, I put everything to `main` branch and then run `quarto publish gh-pages` command. It will put
all rendered web files to `gh-pages` branch.
